              <p>
                Assetsus LLC (“Assetsus LLC”) maintains a business continuity
                plan (the “Plan”) identifying procedures relating to an
                emergency or significant business disruption. The Plan is
                designed to enable Assetsus LLC to meet its existing obligation
                to customers in the event of a significant business disruption.
                Clients should understand that because the Plan contains
                confidential details and proprietary information, it cannot be
                distributed outside of the firm. The Plan is reviewed annually
                and may be updated at any time
              </p>
