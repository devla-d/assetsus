                  IS BITCOIN A GOOD INVESTMENT - THE ANSWER IS, YES!

              <p class="uk-dropcap">
                A collective insanity has sprouted around Bitcoin over the last
                decade. It's hard to predict whether this cryptocurrency will
                become the global reserve currency or a store of value as widely
                accepted as gold, it has posed to have limitless potentials for
                the future. The thrill of riches or ruin leaves some investors
                wary, but informed others have have seen the need to chase the
                opportunity as provided by Kryptbase Asset Trading for massive
                profits from investing in Bitcoin. Bitcoin is certainly a
                revolutionary technology, and it's much less risky in 2023 than
                it was in 2012.
              </p>
              <p>
                After becoming legal tender in Canada, Germany, Slovenia, Malta,
                The Netherlands, Singapore, Estonia, El Salvador among others in
                2021, other countries may look to copy this move to attract
                innovation and development into the future, while others might
                ban it entirely in an attempt to save their fiat currency or
                clear the way for a central bank digital currency, they will
                only find themselves behind in technology and digital
                development. Bitcoin is just one of the internet digital
                currency innovations and it’s already making massive waves
                across the globe. Despite the doom and gloom of the 2022 bear
                market, Bitcoin has solidified its spot in the global
                geopolitical climate, and the 2020s may be the year of massive
                adoption. This has led investors to wonder if Bitcoin is a good
                investment. The answer to this question varies, depending on who
                is asking it and will always lead to this, “the best time to buy
                bitcoin is 5 years and the bad time to buy bitcoin is later, buy
                bitcoin NOW and wait.” Assetsus LLC is here to help you do that,
                providing insurance policies to cover for both capital and
                capital gains.
              </p>
              <p>
                Bitcoin is a good investment as it fits your risk tolerance and
                your general market outlook. The history of the cryptocurrency
                market is actually rather predictable on longer time horizons.
                Bitcoin and Ethereum have traded in relatively regular cycles
                and both have recovered from every major crash (not including
                the most recent, yet) and subsequently reached new all-time
                highs either way Kryptbase Asset trading has studied and
                technically analyzed the market thereby adopting the use of
                automated trading bots and sophisticated softwares like the MT4
                and MT5 trading strategies to generate a steady positive
                progress margin on every trade estimated to +89% as of the last
                time a survey was conducted on January 21 2023. Simply, it has
                been proven that Assetsus LLC can generate a stable return from
                the Crypto(Bitcoin) market whichever way the market moves
                (upwards/downwards) for this reason it has been ranked the
                Number 1 Private Brokerage Company by the Blockchain Council.

              <h3>The History of Bitcoin</h3>
              <p>
                Since its inception, Bitcoin was the 1st digital asset to beget
                the current ecosystem of cryptos. The release of the whitepaper
                describing the tech just after the 2008 financial crisis was a
                quiet start to the cryptocurrency revolution. It’s proven that
                paper money is no so reliable as it is controlled by the
                Government and the Elite. Bitcoin will do to banks same thing
                emails did to the postal office. For quite a while, it grew an
                underground following of investors who saw its future as a
                possible replacement to the physical monetary system. Now
                Bitcoin has become a household name as institutions and
                governments develop ways to serve their customers growing demand
                for exposure.
              </p>
              <p>
                Similar to how the internet was once a speculative investment,
                Bitcoin has received similar criticism. In reality, Bitcoin‘s
                current adoption rate outpaces that of the internet's in 1998,
                and millions of people now own Bitcoin and millions more learn
                about it everyday (BE INFORMED TODAY!) And the spread at which
                its adoption is spreading seems to only be increasing daily.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2021, El Salvador became the 1st country in the world to make
                Bitcoin a legal tender, followed by Canada, Germany, Slovenia,
                Malta, Estonia, Paraguay and other small countries look to
                follow suit. El Salvador is also the first and only country to
                have Bitcoin in its treasury. As of late 2022, El Salvador has
                roughly 3,400 Bitcoin. President Nayib Bukele has not been shy
                about announcing his purchases on Twitter.
              </p>

              <h3>Is Bitcoin a Good Investment Despite the Risk?</h3>
              <p>
                Similar to any speculative investment, buying Bitcoin obviously
                carries significant risk, but this is only in the case that coin
                is left in an exchange like coinbase, crypto.com, robinhood,
                among others and this is why these exchanges have partnered with
                us to handle individual and multiple trading accounts on behalf
                of their clients. As the traditional finance world realizes
                Bitcoin's potential for disruption, they must choose either to
                adopt cryptocurrencies or face irrelevance. We at Assetsus LLC
                strongly advice any informed traditional investor to adopt
                change and technology with bitcoin. Its volatility risk is one
                of the major factors determining whether Bitcoin is a good
                investment but it isn't necessarily good or bad as we already
                have automated trading bots and sophisticated softwares like the
                MT4 and MT5 trading strategies to generate a guaranteed return
                margin. The personal decision to invest in Bitcoin comes down to
                your appetite for tax-free money, freedom, control and your
                perspective on the future of humanity. For example, Russia has
                stated they are looking into cryptocurrencies to lower their
                dependence on the US dollar. Bitcoin has the potential to
                disrupt the US dollar in a massive way, and it is simply too big
                to be ignored at this point. If this disruption is successful,
                Bitcoin will be more than a fantastic investment!
              </p>
              <p>
                The main reason a traditional investor may want exposure to
                Bitcoin is to hedge against inflation, make tax-free income
                (avoiding tax on capital gains), have control over there money
                and potentially the collapse of the fiat-based economy.
                Bitcoin's volatility is a concern to many investors, however
                volatility is expected to decrease forever as institutions and
                governments enter the market with long-term interest. Not only
                that, Volatility has been the foundation on which profits is
                generated by out esteemed professional traders. Our clients are
                in perfect hands.

              <h3>Advantages of Bitcoin Investments</h3>
              <p>
                The overwhelming performance of Bitcoin — as a currency and
                investment — has attracted traditional and institutional
                investors alike. They are all asking: Is Bitcoin a good
                investment? To be fair, it offers you far more several
                advantages over traditional investments.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Liquidity. Bitcoin is arguably 1 of the most liquid investment
                  assets due to the worldwide establishment of trading
                  platforms, exchanges and online brokerages. You can easily
                  trade Bitcoin for cash or assets like gold instantly with
                  incredibly low fees. The high liquidity associated with
                  Bitcoin makes it a potentially great investment vessel if
                  you’re looking for short-term massive profit. Digital
                  currencies may also be a long-term investment due to their
                  high market demand.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Lower inflation risk. Unlike world currencies — which are
                  regulated by their governments — Bitcoin is nearly immune to
                  hyperinflation. It still undergoes inflation but at a
                  predictable rate that is halved every 4 years after which
                  comes a bullish season. The blockchain system is infinite and
                  there’s little need to worry about your cryptos losing their
                  value.
                </li>
                <li>
                  New opportunities. Bitcoin and cryptocurrency trading is
                  relatively young — new coins are becoming mainstream on a
                  daily basis. This newness brings unpredictable swings in price
                  and volatility, which may create opportunities for massive
                  gains.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Minimalistic trading. Stock trading can be a tedious process
                  covered in red tape and can only be done during specific
                  market hours. You must also go through a broker to trade a
                  company’s shares. But Bitcoin trading is minimalistic: simply
                  buy or sell Bitcoin from exchanges whenever you want, 24 hours
                  a day, 7 days a week. Bitcoin transactions are also instant —
                  unlike the settlement of stock trading orders, which could
                  take days or weeks. Bitcoin is by far a much more risk-free
                  lucrative investment.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Disadvantages of Bitcoin Investments</h3>
              <p>
                Bitcoin may be the future of monetary exchange, but it is
                equally important that you are aware of the concerns surrounding
                cryptocurrency investing. Listed below are the only things that
                could make Bitcoin a bad investment. Balancing the pros and cons
                is often the most important thing an investor can do. Note: How
                this is handled, view …”link for Insurance Policy
                <a href="insurance.php">here</a>”)
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Volatility. The price of Bitcoin is always rippling back and
                  forth. If you happened to buy Bitcoin on December 17, 2017,
                  the price was $20,000. Weeks later, you couldn’t sell your
                  investment for more than $7,051. While you'd be doing great
                  now, holding for years at a time is not a viable option for
                  all investors. Mind the word, “HOLDING” this is why it’s
                  always advised to “INVEST” with a trading brokerage company
                  just like Kryptbase Asset TRADING.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Threat of hacking. While Bitcoin's blockchain has never been
                  hacked, individuals can still get hacked if they give out
                  sensitive information, such as their private keys. Also, it's
                  not uncommon for lesser-known exchanges to be hacked. For best
                  security, use a hardware wallet like the Ledger Nano X that
                  stores your digital assets off the internet on an external
                  device.
                </li>
