                At our investment firm, we are dedicated to providing our
                clients with a secure and reliable investment experience. One of
                the ways we accomplish this is through our Capital Back Policy.
                This policy ensures that our clients' investments are protected,
                giving them peace of mind when they entrust their funds to us.
              </p>
              <p></p>

              <p>
                Under this policy, our clients are guaranteed to receive their
                capital back in full, subject to certain conditions. These
                conditions include the completion of the agreed investment term
                and the payment of all applicable fees and charges.
                Additionally, if the investment is prematurely terminated, a
                pro-rata capital return may be payable, based on the terms and
                conditions of the specific investment product.
              </p>

              <p>
                Our Capital Back Policy is an essential component of our
                commitment to client protection and satisfaction. By offering
                this guarantee, we aim to build trust with our clients and
                provide them with the assurance that their investments are
                secure. Our policy is also designed to align our interests with
                those of our clients, as we only profit when our clients do.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is important to note that our Capital Back Policy applies to
                all investment products offered by our firm, including equity,
                fixed income, and alternative investments. This means that
                regardless of the type of investment, our clients can expect the
                same level of protection and security.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to our Capital Back Policy, we also employ strict
                risk management practices and invest in cutting-edge technology
                to ensure the safety and security of our clients' funds. Our
                investment management team is comprised of experienced
                professionals who have a deep understanding of the financial
                markets and a proven track record of delivering strong results.
              </p>
              <p>
                We are committed to transparency and open communication with our
                clients, and as such, we regularly provide updates on the
                performance of their investments. Our clients can also access
                their investment portfolios online at any time, allowing them to
                stay informed and make informed investment decisions.
              </p>

              <p>
                In conclusion, our Capital Back Policy is an integral part of
                our investment philosophy and a testament to our commitment to
                providing our clients with a secure and reliable investment
                experience. We believe that this policy, combined with our
                rigorous risk management practices and experienced investment
                management team, sets us apart in the industry and makes us a
                trusted partner for our clients' investment needs.
